Dear my love,



Three years and six months have passed since we started a wonderful relationship. Unexplainably, I felt from the very first moment that this journey was going to be the best journey of my life. I just didn't know in what way. The look in your eyes was so sincere that I knew I finally found the opportunity to fully exploit my desire to love. Yet, neither was I nor were you in love or blindly enchanted. We both (independently) decided to build up love for one another and this is what I want to tell people about today.



With all my heart and with all my love,



Valeria
