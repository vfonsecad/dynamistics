Yes, I'm currently celebrating my depression. I have had so many wonderful experiences in my life, I have wonderful parents and a family that loves me, I've always had everything that I needed, I've even been the best student, I think I'm a good friend, and I won the lottery with the best man on Earth I have ever met. Nonetheless, today I celebrate infinitely the depression that invaded getting me almost to the end of my life.

Until my 29 years of life, I have had two very bad experiences that have turned my life in a very determined way. I have had of course those very good moments, but those have not changed my life, they have made me a better person, have boosted my way, but they've not made me a different person. I will tell you a bit about the first one and certainly about the second one, but most importantly, I will describe the learnings, because I discovered that the passion and fire in my life rely on that, on everything that I can learn. But rather than what I can learn to say, what I can learn to do.

This story was originally written in Spanish (here it is!) and then I also did the same exercise in Italian (Italian version here) because I wanted to show it to the family of my boyfriend. Then another friend said she would like to read it but I could only offer her English, so I told her that I was planning to do it in English, but that was lie, she motivated me. Hopefully she will like my lie!. Before starting with the stories, for those of you who read up to now and perhaps need to leave already, here is the most important conclusion: Writing, reading, singing, dancing, as well as loving and being happy, are things that anybody at anytime can learn to do.
