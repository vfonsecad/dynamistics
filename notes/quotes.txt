The cruellest insult, on the contrary, which can be offered to the unfortunate, is to appear to make light of their calamities. To seem not to be affected with the joy of our companions is but want of politeness; but not to wear a serious countenance when they tell us their afflictions, is real and gross inhumanity.

A man uses each of his faculties as the standard by which
he judges the same faculty in someone else. I judge your
sight by my sight, your ear by my ear, your reason by my
reason, your resentment by my resentment, your love by my
love. I don’t have—I can’t have—any other way of judging
them
