## The big picture

Did you ever ask that question to yourself? I am not a psychologist and I do not pretend to be one, but luckily, 
thinking about these deep questions and finding their answers made me learn and realize so many aspects 
that could improve my life, making me a happier person and keeping me motivated on a daily basis. Now, 
just as God or the gods are the most credible psychologists in religious terms, 
I think I have become the most credible psychologist for myself and hopefully for those that 
I love and are a direct part of my life.
